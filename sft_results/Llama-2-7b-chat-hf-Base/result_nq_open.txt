Hallucination Examples:
  1. 144 years after it was first began
Analysis: The generated answer correctly states that the construction of La Sagrada Familia is expected to be completed in 2026, which aligns with the ground truth. However, the additional information about it being '144 years after it was first began' is extrinsic and not necessary for answering the question, potentially leading to confusion. The model presents this information with a degree of confidence that may mislead users, hence the scores reflect a moderate level of hallucination severity and overconfidence.
