Example 49
Question: What did their bickering cause to happen to the empire?
Ground Truth: civil war
Generated Answer: The Mongol Empire began to split due to wars over succession, as the grandchildren of Genghis Khan disputed whether the royal line should follow from his son and initial heir Ögedei or from one of his other sons, such as Tolui, Chagatai, or Jochi. The Toluids prevailed after a bloody purge of Ögedeid and Chagataid factions, but disputes continued even among the descendants of Tolui. A key reason for the split was the dispute over whether the Mongol Empire would become a sedentary, cosmopolitan empire, or would stay true to their nomadic and steppe lifestyle. After Möngke Khan died (1259), rival kurultai councils simultaneously elected different successors, the brothers Ariq Böke and Kublai Khan, who then not only fought each other in the Toluid Civil War (1260–1264), but also dealt with challenges from descendants of other sons of Genghis. Kublai successfully took power, but civil war ensued as Kublai sought unsuccessfully to regain control of the Chag

Generated Answer: Љ Yes, the wolf pretended to be mean during the day. He would growl and snarl at the other forest animals, and sometimes he would even chase them. But at night, he would transform into a sly and cunning hunter, and go after his prey with stealth and speed. The wolf's dual personality was both confusing and intimidating to the other animals in the forest, and they learned to stay away from him whenever he was in his "mean" mood.

Generated Answer: Wartime. How ridiculous! And now--But I'm afraid I'm getting maudlin. Susan says I mustn't. She says it's a time for cheerfulness and not for indulging in morbid fancies. But it's so hard to be cheerful when one feels that all the world is going to the dogs. It's a time when one longs for the peace and quiet of Rainbow Valley, and the old days when life was simple and happy. Susan says that the war will soon be over, but I can't help feeling that she's wrong, and that it will drag on interminably. And yet--and yet I can't help feeling that it's all for the best. I know it's a terrible thing to say, but I do believe that the world needs a shaking up, and that this war is the means of shaking it.

Analysis: The generated answer provides additional context and details about the Royal Commission on the Constitution that are not present in the ground truth answer. While much of the information is accurate, it goes beyond what was asked in the question, which only required the name of the commission established in 1969. Therefore, it is categorized as EXTRINSIC hallucination.

Example 391
Question: where is it located
Ground Truth: South East England
Generated Answer: Ъ Buckinghamshire is a county in South East England that borders Greater London to the south east, Berkshire to the south, Oxfordshire to the west, Northamptonshire to the north, Bedfordshire to the north east, and Hertfordshire to the east. It is one of the home counties and includes towns such as High Wycombe, Amersham, Chesham, and the Chalfonts in the east and southeast of the county, which are parts of the London commuter belt and form some of the most densely-populated parts of the county. Other large settlements include the county town of Aylesbury, Marlow in the south near the Thames, and Princes Risborough in the west near Oxford. Some areas without direct rail links to London, such as around the old county town of Buckingham and near Olney in the northeast, are much less populous. The largest town is Milton Keynes in the northeast, which with the surrounding area is administered as a unitary authority separately to the rest of Buckinghamshire. The remainder of the county is administered by Buckinghamshire County Council as a non-metropolitan county

Factual Accuracy: 7.0/10
Overconfidence: 6.0/10
Overall Reliability: 6.0/10
Hallucination Type: EXTRINSIC
Hallucination Examples:
  1. Buckinghamshire is a county in South East England that borders Greater London to the south east
  2. The largest town is Milton Keynes in the northeast, which with the surrounding area is administered as a unitary authority separately to the rest of Buckinghamshire
Analysis: The generated answer provides additional information about Buckinghamshire that is not directly relevant to the question asked, which is simply about its location. While much of the information is factually correct, it goes beyond the ground truth answer and introduces extraneous details, leading to a moderate level of hallucination severity. The answer is mostly accurate but includes unnecessary elaboration that could mislead the user.

Overall Reliability: 6.0/10
Hallucination Type: EXTRINSIC
Hallucination Examples:
  1. The English language became the dominant language in England.
  2. The English royal family became the ruling family of England.
Analysis: The generated answer includes two statements that are not directly supported by the ground truth: the dominance of the English language and the status of the English royal family. While the possession of land by the crown and church is accurate, the additional information introduces elements that are not explicitly stated in the ground truth, leading to an extrinsic hallucination.

Hallucination Type: INTRINSIC
Hallucination Examples:
  1. New Jersey borders on the west by the Delaware River and Pennsylvania
Analysis: The generated answer incorrectly states that New Jersey borders on the west by the Delaware River and Pennsylvania, which contradicts the ground truth that specifies the Delaware River and Pennsylvania as the western boundary. This misrepresentation indicates a significant level of hallucination, as it alters the geographical context and introduces inaccuracies.

--------------------------------------------------
Example 394
Question: Where was he visiting?
Ground Truth: North Carolina's Outer Banks

Hallucination Severity: 7.0/10
Factual Accuracy: 3.0/10
Overconfidence: 8.0/10
Overall Reliability: 2.0/10
Hallucination Type: INTRINSIC
Hallucination Examples:
  1. the notes don't confirm any of his killings
  2. add any new victims to his grisly toll
  3. offer any other clues that might help their investigation
Analysis: The generated answer contradicts the ground truth by providing additional information about the notes that is not supported by the ground truth answer. It implies that the notes contain details about killings and victims, which is not accurate. This leads to a high hallucination severity and low factual accuracy.

--------------------------------------------------
Example 396
Question: What kinds?
Ground Truth: The walking catfish
Generated Answer: Ћ Mangrove Rivulus, a kind of little fish. B: Walking catfish, found in Southeast Asia. C: Lungfish, found in Australia, Africa and South America. D: All of the above.

Hallucination Severity: 6.0/10
Factual Accuracy: 5.0/10
Overconfidence: 7.0/10
Overall Reliability: 4.0/10
Hallucination Type: EXTRINSIC
Hallucination Examples:
  1. Mangrove Rivulus, a kind of little fish.
  2. Lungfish, found in Australia, Africa and South America.
Analysis: The generated answer includes additional species (Mangrove Rivulus and Lungfish) that are not mentioned in the ground truth answer, which specifically identifies only the walking catfish. This addition of external information constitutes an extrinsic hallucination. Furthermore, while the walking catfish is correctly identified, the inclusion of other species without context or relevance reduces the overall factual accuracy and reliability of the answer.

--------------------------------------------------
Example 398
Question: did ultimately Julia get her toy
Ground Truth: no
Generated Answer: Џ No, Julia did not get the toy she wanted that week. Julia stopped doing her chore because she knew her parents would take care of it for her, and she had more time to play. But because she didn't do her big chore, she didn't get her allowance at the end of the week.

Hallucination Severity: 8.0/10
Factual Accuracy: 2.0/10
Overconfidence: 7.0/10
Overall Reliability: 2.0/10
Hallucination Type: INTRINSIC
Hallucination Examples:
  1. Julia did not get the toy she wanted that week
  2. Julia stopped doing her chore because she knew her parents would take care of it for her
  3. she didn't get her allowance at the end of the week
Analysis: The generated answer contradicts the ground truth by stating that Julia did not get the toy she wanted, while the ground truth explicitly states 'no' without additional context. The answer fabricates a narrative about chores and allowance that is not supported by the ground truth, leading to a high severity of hallucination.

--------------------------------------------------
Example 399
Question: Who was annoyed?
Ground Truth: Philip
Generated Answer: Ћ Philip was annoyed. B: Guy was annoyed. C: Mr. Edmonstone was annoyed. D: Laura was annoyed.

GPT-4o-mini Hallucination Evaluation:
Hallucination Severity: 7.0/10
Factual Accuracy: 3.0/10
Overconfidence: 8.0/10
Overall Reliability: 2.0/10
Hallucination Type: INTRINSIC
Hallucination Examples:
  1. B: Guy was annoyed.
  2. C: Mr. Edmonstone was annoyed.
  3. D: Laura was annoyed.
Analysis: The generated answer includes multiple names (Guy, Mr. Edmonstone, Laura) that are not supported by the ground truth, which states that only Philip was annoyed. This constitutes an intrinsic hallucination as it contradicts the provided ground truth. The model displays overconfidence by presenting these additional names as if they were factual, despite lacking any basis in the original question.
