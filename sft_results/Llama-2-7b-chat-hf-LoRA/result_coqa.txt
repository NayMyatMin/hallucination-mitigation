Example 5
Question: What is an example?
Ground Truth: raising the age for driving
Generated Answer: Ћ Here is an example of how the information can be used to create a news report: According to a recent study, the brains of teenagers are not fully developed until the age of twenty-five. This means that teenagers are more likely to take risks than adults, as their brains are not yet fully formed. The study found that the part of the brain responsible for judgment and decision-making is particularly undeveloped in teenagers. This could explain why young people are more willing to take risks, such as driving too fast. However, not all researchers agree with these findings, with some saying there is not enough evidence to support the idea that teenage brains are not fully developed.

GPT-4o-mini Hallucination Evaluation:
Hallucination Severity: 7.0/10
Factual Accuracy: 3.0/10
Overconfidence: 6.0/10
Overall Reliability: 4.0/10
Hallucination Type: INTRINSIC
Hallucination Examples:
  1. Julia did not get the toy she wanted that week.
Analysis: The generated answer contradicts the ground truth by implying that Julia did not get the toy she wanted, which is consistent with the ground truth. However, it introduces unsupported details about the timing ('that week'), which are not present in the ground truth, leading to a higher hallucination severity. The answer is factually incorrect in the context of the question, as it does not align with the simple 'no' response of the ground truth.

--------------------------------------------------
Example 399
Question: Who was annoyed?
Ground Truth: Philip
Generated Answer: a) Guy b) Philip c) Laura d) William of Deloraine

Factual Accuracy: 8.0/10
Overconfidence: 4.0/10
Overall Reliability: 7.0/10
Hallucination Type: INTRINSIC
Hallucination Examples:
  1. Guy
  2. Laura
  3. William of Deloraine
Analysis: The generated answer includes three additional names (Guy, Laura, William of Deloraine) that are not supported by the ground truth, which states that Philip was the only person mentioned as annoyed. While Philip is correctly included, the presence of other names introduces an intrinsic hallucination, as they contradict the provided ground truth.
