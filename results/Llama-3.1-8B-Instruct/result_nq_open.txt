Overconfidence: 7.0/10
Overall Reliability: 2.0/10
Hallucination Type: INTRINSIC
Hallucination Examples:
  1. Radcliffe Line
Analysis: The generated answer 'Radcliffe Line' is incorrect as it refers to a historical boundary established during the partition of India in 1947, while the current boundary between India and Bangladesh is referred to as the International Border (IB). This answer contradicts the provided ground truth and demonstrates a significant level of fabrication, leading to a high hallucination severity score.
