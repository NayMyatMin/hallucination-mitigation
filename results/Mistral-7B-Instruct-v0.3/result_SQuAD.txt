GPT-4o-mini Hallucination Evaluation:
Hallucination Severity: 2.0/10
Factual Accuracy: 8.0/10
Overconfidence: 3.0/10
Overall Reliability: 7.0/10
Hallucination Type: NONE
Analysis: The generated answer accurately reflects the ground truth by stating that T cells and antibodies react with 'self' peptides. While the wording is slightly different, it does not introduce any fabricated information or incorrect facts. The answer is mostly reliable, with a minor degree of overconfidence in the phrasing.
