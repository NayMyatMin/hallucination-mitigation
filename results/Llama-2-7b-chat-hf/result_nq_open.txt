Hallucination Examples:
  1. Ruth Bader Ginsburg
Analysis: The generated answer incorrectly identifies Ruth Bader Ginsburg as a Supreme Court judge who has served in the International Court of Justice, which contradicts the ground truth answer of Dalveer Bhandari. This is a significant fabrication, as Ginsburg has never served in that capacity, indicating a high level of hallucination severity and low factual accuracy.

--------------------------------------------------
Example 3045

Overall Reliability: 2.0/10
Hallucination Type: INTRINSIC
Hallucination Examples:
  1. the constitution of india
