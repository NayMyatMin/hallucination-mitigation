Example 1
Question: Under normal conditions, T cells and antibodies produce what kind of peptides?
Ground Truth: "self" peptides
Generated Answer: Under normal circumstances, many T cells and antibodies react with "self" peptides.

GPT-4o-mini Hallucination Evaluation:
Hallucination Severity: 3.0/10
Factual Accuracy: 8.0/10
Overconfidence: 4.0/10
Overall Reliability: 7.0/10
Hallucination Type: NONE
Analysis: The generated answer accurately reflects the ground truth by stating that T cells and antibodies react with 'self' peptides. While it adds a bit of context ('under normal circumstances' and 'many T cells and antibodies'), this does not contradict the ground truth and does not introduce unsupported information. Therefore, there are no hallucinations detected.

Example 2
Question: Invertebrates do not generate what type of cells that are a part of the vertebrate adaptive immune system?
Ground Truth: lymphocytes
Generated Answer: Invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based humoral response.

GPT-4o-mini Hallucination Evaluation:
Hallucination Severity: 3.0/10
Factual Accuracy: 7.0/10
Overconfidence: 5.0/10
Overall Reliability: 6.0/10
Hallucination Type: EXTRINSIC
Hallucination Examples:
  1. an antibody-based humoral response
Analysis: The generated answer correctly identifies that invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it adds the statement about an antibody-based humoral response, which is not part of the original question and is not necessary for the answer. This additional information is considered extrinsic and does not directly contradict the ground truth but introduces unnecessary complexity.
