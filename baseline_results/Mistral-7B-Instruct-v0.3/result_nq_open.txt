Hallucination Type: EXTRINSIC
Hallucination Examples:
  1. a Canaanite god to whom children were sacrificed
Analysis: The generated answer introduces external information about Molech being a Canaanite god associated with child sacrifice, which is not the same as the ground truth answer that simply states 'king.' This indicates a significant deviation from the expected answer, leading to a high hallucination severity score. The factual accuracy is low because the generated answer does not align with the ground truth, and the model presents this information with a degree of confidence that suggests it is factual.

--------------------------------------------------
Example 2606
Question: what areas of africa were involved in colonization
Ground Truth: 90 percent of the continent
